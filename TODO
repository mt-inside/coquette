how to disconn from ecu to handshake another? Because handshakes start with two command-ends, I wonder if just send a new handshake?
commands to other cpus (each cmd take an ecu and remember / switch if different) ?
add a layer where I can supply an arbitrary set of registers to watch. it should use as many reads as necc to get all those registers, and return them.
consider adding a layer where i can "poll" / "select" a set of registers, and only get change notifications.
